A modified version of class that computes dark matter decay into photons,
treating consistently energy budget both at the background and perurbation level. 

See our paper for details: [Hill & Bolliet (2022)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2650075).

Code based on a modified class version communicated by @Michalychforever and used in [Ivanov, Ali-Haimoud & Lesgourgues (2020)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1797294).


Our code is currently based on v2.9.4 of class. It is possible to upgrade it to v3 using the procedure outlines on J. Lesgourgues' website. We leave this to future work, if interest arises.
